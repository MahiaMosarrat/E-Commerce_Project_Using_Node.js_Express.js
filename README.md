    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Add necessary environment variables, such as your database connection string and application port.
    ```
    PORT=3000
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string_here
    # Add any other sensitive keys or configurations
    ```
    *Replace `your_database_connection_string_here` with your actual database URL.*

5.  **Database Setup:**
    Ensure your chosen database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) is running and accessible. If your project requires specific migrations or data seeding, add those instructions here.

6.  **Start the server:**
    To run the application in a production-like environment:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    For development, using `nodemon` (if installed globally or as a dev dependency) is recommended for automatic restarts on file changes:
    ```bash
    npx nodemon app.js
    ```
7.  **Open in Browser:**
    Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you defined in your `.env` file).
